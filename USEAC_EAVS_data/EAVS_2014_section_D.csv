The D2c “TOTAL” would have reflected the earlier noted count from D2f (20 total) but that was reduced to 8 “Election offices” noted in the “Election Day voting” section which is part of the original 20 “Early voting - Election offices”.  These 8 sites were not added but merely reduced to 8 “Election Offices” on Election Day to account for All-Mail jurisdictional sites that are open on Election Day. Each of the 724 precincts is technically assigned a voting location (e.g. polling place or replacement ballot site for All-Mail elections). In certain areas some precinct polling places were co-located (36 co-locations) within the same facility and that is why the “physical” polling place location total (651) is less than the number of machines used (687) and also less than the Total Precincts (D1a) that exist (724). We had 7 All-Mail precincts where the total number of registered voters within those precincts was less than 25 registered voters. These All-Mail precincts were not assigned a physical polling location and consequently reduce the “physical polling place” total as well.,3848,"As a note, we also hired 116 citizen board Troubleshooters that do not serve as polling place board workers but are assigned several specific polling place locations to assist the board workers at these locations with any issues that come up on Election Day. This quantity of additional workers (116) is NOT reflected in the above grand total.",152,83,227,311,1361,1714,3848,"Maricopa County implemented ""Student"" poll workers program back in 2008.  Since its inception, we  continue to realize a steady increase in participation amongst students.  For this 2014 General election, of the 3,848 workers, we had over 152 of these board workers that were ""Student"" poll workers.",2 - Somewhat difficult,"Some precincts were easier to staff than others, however the most difficulty we had in all precincts were staffing and keeping Bi-Lingual Board Workers.  The recruitment process for “standard” poll workers was neither difficult nor easy.  In some rural areas, it was a bit difficult to recruit poll workers.  We do ask poll workers to work outside of their precinct but many of the rural areas were just too far for some out-of-precinct workers to accept."

A clerk/judge makes $65 for an approximate 14 hour day. It's nearly impossible to bring in ""new blood"" at those rates. Plus, 2014 was the first year our county government forced us to collect W4's and Homeland Security forms, along with copies of Driver's Licenses and Birth Certificates/Passports/Social Security cards for ALL poll workers. This knocked out several dozen who were simply irritated and inconvenienced."

Another issue is that so many people are working steady jobs well past the traditional retirement age, therefore they are unavailable to work the elections. We also had several (between 6 – 10) that called a day or two before the election stating they were sick, had to go to the doctor, had sick children etc. This makes it extremely difficult because even though we try to have a couple non-partisan workers on-call for emergencies, we can’t replace that many workers last minute.
