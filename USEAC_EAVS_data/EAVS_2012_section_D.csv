AZ,MARICOPA COUNTY,401300000,724,"Arizona underwent “Redistricting” prior to the 2012 General Election and part of the redistricting efforts for Maricopa County was to redraw and consolidate precincts.  Prior to 2012, Maricopa County had 1,124 precincts (since 2006).  With the increase in the number of voters in Maricopa County on the Permanent Early Voting List (1,162,067), we were able to merge several precincts to reach a new precinct total for 2012 of 724 precincts.",697,677,0,,,12,3,5,697,"Secure ""ballot box only"" drop site","       D2a is a total number of physical polling places (677) IN ADDITION to the 15 early voting centers (3 offices and 12 off-site locations) and the 5 drop off “ballot box” sites for a total of 697.  “Election Day” voting (D2b) is only offered at polling place locations.  Each of the 724 precincts is technically assigned a polling place.  However, in certain areas some precinct polling places were co-located within the same facility and that is why the ""physical"" polling place location total is less than the number of precincts existing.  A co-located polling place consists of two different and separate boards specifically assigned to a given precinct and a specific set of voters within that precinct.  Additionally, we had 7 All-Mail Precincts where the total number of registered voters within those precincts was less than 25 registered voters.  These All-Mail precincts were still co-located and assigned to a physical polling place in case a voter opted to vote in-person versus by mail.",4820,"       As a note, we also hired 119 citizen board Troubleshooters that do not serve as polling place board workers but are assigned several specific polling place locations to assist the board workers at these locations with any issues that come up on Election Day. This quantity of additional workers (119) is NOT reflected in the above grand total.",167,188,245,1260,1565,1395,4820,"       Maricopa County implemented ""Student"" poll workers program back in 2008.  Since its inception, we have seen a steady increase in participation amongst students.  For this 2012 General election, of the 4,820 workers, we had over 167 of these board workers that were ""Student"" poll workers.",Neither difficult nor easy,"The recruitment process was neither difficult nor easy.  By this we mean with the 724 precincts (677 physical polling locations) we have here in Maricopa County, we found many polling places where we had a surplus of workers due to the more populace location which then made it easy to locate sufficient number of board workers.  However, in some rural areas, it was somewhat difficult to recruit poll workers.  We do ask poll workers to work outside of their precinct but many of the rural areas were just too far for some out-of-precinct workers to accept. "
